            <h2>Trashcon journey</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Our first patented technology (TrashBot) separates this worst form of waste automatically with minimal or nil human intervention.</li>
              <li>Operate at capacities starting 5 tons per day to 250 tons per day this means that we can cater from a village to a whole city itself. One of our plants near Bangalore cleans 23 villages.</li>
              <li>TrashBot separates the input waste in primarily 2 components – food waste – this can be composted or sent to biogas and the other component is dry waste which primarily consists of plastics and paper. This can be sent to local recyclers.</li>
              <li>Recycling Multi-layered Plastics</li>
              <li>A Proprietary technology that segregates municipal solid waste or mixed waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable components over 85% efficiency, with minimal or nill human intervention.</li>
              <li>We provide an end-to-end automated solution that can make any space
(airport, mall, IT park, village, city etc.)
completely ZERO WASTE!</li>
